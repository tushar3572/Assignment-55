    "In MongoDB, the methods `delete_one()`, `delete_many()`, and `drop()` are used for removing documents from a collection or an entire collection from a database. Here’s a detailed explanation of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `delete_one()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `delete_one()` method is used to delete a single document from a collection that matches the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Usage**: This method is useful when you want to remove only one specific document, even if multiple documents match the criteria. The method will delete the first document it finds that matches the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  result = collection.delete_one({\"name\": \"Alice\"})\n",
    "  print(f\"Number of documents deleted: {result.deleted_count}\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `delete_many()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `delete_many()` method is used to delete multiple documents from a collection that match the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Usage**: This method is useful when you want to remove all documents that meet certain conditions, such as deleting all documents of a particular user or all entries older than a specific date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  result = collection.delete_many({\"age\": {\"$lt\": 30}})\n",
    "  print(f\"Number of documents deleted: {result.deleted_count}\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `drop()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `drop()` method is used to completely remove a collection from a database. This action deletes the collection along with all its documents, indexes, and associated metadata.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Usage**: This method is useful when you want to remove a collection entirely, typically when it's no longer needed, or to reset the database state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  collection.drop()\n",
    "  print(\"Collection dropped successfully.\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`delete_one()`**: Deletes the first document that matches the filter criteria.\n",
    "- **`delete_many()`**: Deletes all documents that match the filter criteria.\n",
    "- **`drop()`**: Deletes an entire collection, including all its documents and indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Caution**: Deleting documents or dropping collections is a destructive operation, so it should be performed carefully to avoid accidental data loss.\n",
    "- **Return Value**: Both `delete_one()` and `delete_many()` return a result object containing information about the operation, such as the number of documents deleted (`deleted_count`).\n",
    "- **No Undo**: Once documents are deleted or a collection is dropped, they cannot be recovered unless you have a backup."
